# Vegas Betting Odds for NBA Games

## Description of Problem
Vegas releases betting odds in order to attract bettors to bet on the outcome of a certain sports event. In this case, for an NBA game, Vegas would hypothetically say that for every dollar that a bettor bets, they will get 'x' amount of dollars if they correctly bet that a certain team wins. Otherwise, they lose their money and it goes to Vegas. However there is a fine line between attracting people to actually bet on the games so that external bettors will lose and the organization in Vegas makes the most money out of lost bets. In this project, I will be introducing several models and picking the best model that this certain organization in Vegas can use to figure out which team will likely win a sports match and so entice bettors to bet on the other team, and thus win all of their money.
